# Pipex Project
- Overview:
The Pipex project introduces a shell implementation of pipes, involving two files and two commands. The primary objective is to create a pipeline between the commands, where the output of the first command serves as the input for the second command. The final result is then stored in the second file. This project is designed to familiarize you with the execve function for executing the correct executables, navigating the environmental variables, and handling multiple commands in the bonus part.

## Key Features:
- Pipes Implementation:

Creates a pipeline between two commands using the shell.
- File Input and Output:

Utilizes files as input and output for the commands in the pipeline.
- Execve Function:

Implements the execve function to execute the correct executables.
- Environmental Variable Handling:

Navigates and utilizes environmental variables as needed.
